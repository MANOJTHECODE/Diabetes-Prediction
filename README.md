# Diabetes-Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes detection using the diabetes dataset. The dataset contains various features such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The project involves data collection and analysis, data standardization using StandardScaler, train-test split, training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, evaluating the model's accuracy, and creating a predictive system to classify a person as diabetic or non-diabetic based on input data. The model achieves an accuracy score of around 78% on the training data and 77% on the test data.
